            <p>Amazon is not known to have a design culture but looking at its evolution from 1995, it is evident that its user experience is still very important. 
            For e-commerce usability, Amazon.com used to be the model. In 2001, a total of 20 e-commerce sites were evaluated and Amazon was the clear winner, scoring 65% higher than the average of the other 19 sites. Having the Web's best usability served Amazon well: sales increased by 126% from 2001 to 2004.
            Rather than simply copy any one site, it's best to follow the hundreds of detailed research findings about e-commerce user experience. But people often prefer to be told just one thing. For many years, that one thing in e-commerce design was "Do like Amazon." No more.
            Amazon has recently changed so much that the average e-commerce site will reduce its usability by emulating its design too closely.
            Paradoxically, Amazon's design may work well for Amazon itself. The company is simply so different from other e-commerce sites that what's good for Amazon is not good for normal sites.
